        <p class="text-content">I am a team player and a proactive developer who suggest and adapt new strategies or new technologies from co-developers or from technical meetups or seminars that can help to boost the development of the project.</p>
        <p class="text-content">I do follow to use and implement suggested best practices as of the current trend like Agile, git flow, DevOps, scrum, pair programming, open source and collaboration.</p>
        <p class="text-content">In my <span class="exp-year">10</span> years of my career I learned how the software development works from planning to implementation and testing until the deployment, support, new features and bug fixes phase. </p>
